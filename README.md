# Results:

Pytesseract v3.ipynb -- Final version of codes for our approach. 

Accuracy Test.ipynb -- Code that gets error rate of an image into a dataframe.(One image per output)

df_ave_error_revised.csv -- Excel sheet of the average error rates for our test set. 



# Experiments: 

Practice.ipynb -- PDF pen pro outputs. 

Pytesseract.ipynb -- Codes using different approaches we thought about in the 
                     early stages of the project.
                     
Pytesseract v2.ipynb -- Code to test one of the best approaches we had.
